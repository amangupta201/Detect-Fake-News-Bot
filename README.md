# Fact Shield
This project combines HTML, Bootstrap CSS, JS, jQuery for the frontend, Amazon DynamoDB as the database, and Python with Keras, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for the backend. By incorporating the latest GDELT Geo 2.0 API, the app fetches news articles related to 'fake news' and uses sophisticated machine learning models to predict their authenticity. This project underscores my commitment to addressing pressing societal issues through technology and my capability to build robust, scalable systems.
